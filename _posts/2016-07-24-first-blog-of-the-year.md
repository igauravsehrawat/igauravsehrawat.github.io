## First blog of the year

It's just unbelievable, I didn't wrote a blog in such a long time. Focus isn't on blogging but not to stagnate.

There must be something happening, must be learning new technology? must be creating some app or service through code? Well that definitely was happening, I didn't shared it. Next blog I will be describing all the good and cool stuff I have been working on. I am hopping to write a blog fortnightly for sure.

Intentionally wanted this to be short blog, just to make a promise to write more.
