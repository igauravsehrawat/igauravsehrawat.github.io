## Planning Does Not Work While Judging Does

>    Yes.

Planning includes others people actions, well that can change instantaneously . So the plan gets nowhere. Is that what you want ? NO.

Judging part includes you as an integral part. Well you can trust yourself more than anybody else yourself.

Planning also sounds more like a evil intention. Judging either goes right or wrong . That's all.

>   Goal is same but paths are different . Choose the right one.
