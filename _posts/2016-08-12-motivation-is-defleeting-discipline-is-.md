> Don't bank on motivation. It's inherently a bad idea.

Looking for motivation is similar to addiction IMHO. You won't get started till you get that hit. Motivation is like a resistant virus, the same motivation won't work every day. You will need something new each day. A particular thing about motivation is -

> You will get motivation when you least expect it.

You ask, what's the alternative. I say <b>"Discipline"</b>.

Discipline keeps you on target without getting deviated. Discipline tells you to "Just Do It" every single time, anywhere, anytime. Discipline is reliable, discipline is the "Motivation". Not just discipline, self-discipline. Your mentor won't be with you all the time, you need to train your mind to discipline itself.

Till next time.
