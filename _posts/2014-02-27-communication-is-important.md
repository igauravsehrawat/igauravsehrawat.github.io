##Communication Is Important

Communication is very important . This is productivity part for any job. This shows

+ commitment
+ your understanding ,
+ progress towards goals,
+ problems in goals


It is acutally not the pair programming instead it's actually the communication which is best practice in developing and writing codes. If one is thinking that he/she will surprise the world just like that in a go.

       You are at the wrong side .

Productivity comes when you don't even think about it .
