This is me a hardcore gitter.[The one who push/commit code every single day ,Not only on Github ;-)]
I am <b>polyglot programmer</b>. I have coded in mostly all the modern programming language available that too apart from hello world. 
Right now i am focused on web , mobile and data analysis part. I am dead serious about python and javascript ecosystem. 

My talent ingredient includes :
    
     1.Engineering 
     2.Reverse Engineering 
     3.Hacking 
     4.Being the pirate 

I am fan of beautifully designed softwares and strives for them.

That's pretty much all to describe. YOLO. I like to <a href="https://twitter.com/root3d" target="_blank">tweet</a> when I code.
