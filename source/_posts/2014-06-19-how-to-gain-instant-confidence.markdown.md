That's true and but isn't that is unfair ,people judge you just by confidence . 
One quick way to gain confidence is : "Do what you are afraid of ?".   
Whether it is to prepare for a speech " Do a mock up speech in front of friends?"  
Be it a algorithm problem "Just ask someone else for help if stuck but don't put it on tomorrow !"  
or Be it making a Blogging site: "Just do it . Refactor it later".  

One shouldn't wait for perfection . Iterate later .
And Let keep it short that way .
