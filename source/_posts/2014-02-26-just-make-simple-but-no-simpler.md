##Just Make Simple but No Simpler##


The above lines are of mighty Albert Einstein. 
Don't assume yourself the complexity of the problem . For example jeklly and octopress and static site generator . That's all .
No need to make surprises for yourself.

You put your content in markdown , preview it and generate the relevant content in html,css,js using jekyll. And ultimately do the rake deploy.

One should definetly agree that there is life beyond pressing buttons . Just code and deploy .
